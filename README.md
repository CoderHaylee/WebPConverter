# WebPConverter
A Simple Script to change every .webp File into a .png for systems that can't read the file type.

This was born out of the fact the internet likes to use .webps, however for pictures I needed to save and use, I didn't have an application to view or edit the pictures at the time.
This script needs to be ran in the directory you're trying to work in.
