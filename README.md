# WebPConverter
A Simple Script to change every .webp File into a .png for systems that can't read the file type.

This was born out of the fact the internet likes to use .webps, however for pictures I needed to save and use, I didn't have an application to view or edit the pictures at the time.
This script needs to be ran in the directory you're trying to work in.

This Script relies on another program to due the actual conversions. If you don't have it try "sudo apt-get install webp" or using your respective package Manager on your Distro.
